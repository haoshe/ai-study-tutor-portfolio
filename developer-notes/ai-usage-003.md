# AI Usage Documentation - Abdul Wadood

## Tools Used
- **GitHub Copilot** - Code completion and boilerplate generation
- **ChatGPT (GPT-4)** - Debugging, problem-solving, architecture guidance
- **Claude (Sonnet 4.5)** - Code review and complex implementations

## Strategy

**Code Completion**: Used Copilot for boilerplate code, imports, React components, and Spring Boot annotations.

**Debugging & Learning**: Consulted ChatGPT/Claude for:
- Understanding error messages and stack traces
- Database configuration issues (MySQL setup, user permissions)
- Spring Security and JWT token implementation
- CORS errors and API integration
- Git workflow issues (branch management, merge requests)

**Architecture**: Used AI to discuss DTO patterns, security configurations, and database schema design.

## Key Prompts
- "How to implement Remember Me functionality with JWT tokens in Spring Boot?"
- "MySQL connection denied for user - how to troubleshoot?"
- "How to handle CORS errors between React frontend and Spring backend?"
- "Accidentally committed to main instead of feature branch - how to fix?"
- "Failed to fetch error in React - common causes and solutions?"

## Reflections

### What Worked Well
- **Speed**: AI significantly accelerated boilerplate coding and error diagnosis
- **Learning**: Helped understand Spring Security architecture and JWT lifecycle
- **Problem-solving**: Quickly identified root causes from stack traces

### What Didn't Work Well
- **Context**: Generic solutions required adaptation for our specific setup
- **Environment**: Struggled with Coder-specific networking and deployment issues
- **Over-reliance**: Had to verify suggestions against documentation to avoid misunderstandings

### Strategy Applied
- Used AI for initial implementation, then manually refined
- Always cross-referenced with official documentation
- Tested AI solutions in isolation before integration
- Maintained dev logs for AI-assisted features

## Conclusion
AI tools were invaluable for accelerating development and learning new frameworks (Spring Security, JWT, React). However, critical thinking and verification remained essential. AI served as a knowledgeable assistant, not a replacement for understanding the codebase.

**Key Takeaway**: Most effective when used as a learning tool and productivity enhancer, requiring developer judgment for quality and security.
