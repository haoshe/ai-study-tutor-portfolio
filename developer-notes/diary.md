## Week 3: Nov 2-7 — A Hopeful Start
- First week the team sat down and made great progress.
- Ideas refined and a tangible MVP goal was created:

  - File upload feature
  - Working backend with a database
  - Integrated OpenAI API system

  - Tomas → DevOps & CI/CD

## Week 4: Nov 9-16 — Major Issues Upon MVP Submission
- Week filled with issues, misunderstandings, and failed expectations.
- Initial Monday deadline set to allow time for fixes.
- Team members did not complete parts in time or communicate effectively.
- Result: six separate components instead of a unified system.
- Major error:
  - Frontend worked locally but not in Coder due to lack of environment testing/early refusal to use the enviornment.
- Final outcome:
  - Successful submission with little time to spare.
  - Below expected quality relative to effort.
- Special thanks to Hao — Most Valuable Player for the week.

## Week 5: Nov 16-23 — Solutions and Team Coordination
- Tomas moved Scrum earlier in the week to address performance issues in previous week.
- Harsh but fair assessments made of the prior week's performance.
- Clear and concrete expectations set to reduce ambiguity.
- Significant improvement across all areas:
  - Frontend revamped
  - Files successfully integrated
  - Database set up
- Team morale increased; the project became something to be proud of.
